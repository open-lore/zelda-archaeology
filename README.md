Welcome to ***Zelda Archaeology*** *(ZA)*, a central location that takes *Zelda* theories seriously - all written and shared under the open source **Creative Commons license (CC BY-SA 4.0)**.

Here, we as the *Zelda* fan community dig deep into the internet's unofficial - often non-canon - *Zelda* theories and compile them into an easy to reference format.
Across multiple phases, we'll ① collect and organize here on GitHub, ② publish them to an accessible website, and ③ finally craft them into a beautiful physical compendium of books akin to the [*Master Works*](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild_–_Creating_a_Champion) reference book - potentially sold through Kickstarter or equivalent.

We're a group of archaeologists, collectively traversing the rich worlds of *The Legend of Zelda* series - making sense of our ever expanding insights into the best video game series on the planet.

## Project Motivation

New *The Legend of Zelda* games are only released every few years.
In between those milestone events, fans keep the *Zelda* excitement alive by sharing news and rumors about upcoming releases, creating art and discussing the finer details of each game.

Some of the best *Zelda* content on the web are the increasingly in-depth fan theories.
These theories highlight details that are seldom explicit within the games themselves, weaving together a rich tapestry of depth of story and lore that transcend the games themselves.
Often pushing up against official canon by inferring details not explicitly stated - or even intended - by *Nintendo*, this dedicated community of *Zelda* fans find patterns casual players typically don't see.

Sometimes, these theories take on canonical meaning when *Nintendo* adopts them officially - for example, the hotly debated official *Zelda* timeline was originally an elaborate fan theory.
While at other times, fan favorite theories are cast by the wayside as new games are released and core pillars of those theories are dismantled by the newly integrated official canon.

But that's part of the fun of debating and developing *Zelda* theories!

The ever shifting landscape of theories are scattered all over the internet in nearly every format imaginable.
They're discussed in forums dating back to pre-social times.
Legacy *Zelda* themed IRC channels gave way to Discord and Slack channels.
They're fleshed out on Facebook, Twitter, and whatever else the kids are doing these days.
You'll find them on Reddit, blogs, fan wikis and YouTube.

But in every case, there's no central location dedicated to compiling the theories themselves.

***Zelda Archaeology*** is that central location.

## Project Vision

While the process outlined below will most be more organic than the documentation makes it feel, here are the high level phases that indicate progress.

### Phase 1  - Collecting and Organizing (Current Phase)

The first step is to get a good idea of the landscape. We'll need all the help we can get (see how to CONTRIBUTE below) as we scour the internet, compiling huge lists of locations that discuss specific *Zelda* theories.
Then we'll collectively organize that list into categories that make sense so we can dive into **Phase 2**.

### Phase 2 - Writing and Online Publishing

We'll rewrite all of those theories (yes, all of them) in a consistent format and voice ready for publishing.
Then we'll build a public friendly version controlled website to publish everything to, keeping every original reference intact like the caring and responsible researchers we are.

### Phase 3 - Physical Publishing

There's no telling how large this project will end up being, but It's easy to imagine it could span multiple books.
We'll bring in artists, print designers and publishing experts to create physical books for your bookshelf - all organized in a way that you're proud to display.

These books can be sold by anyone through an affiliate program, with the proceeds distributed fairly to everyone who has contributed to the creation of the content.

## Contribute

*ZA* is an open source project - entirely built by you - a special breed of passionate *Zelda* fans that want to share the depth of the worlds you love.
There is no central authority or gatekeeper - which wouldn't even make sense.

If you've ever lurked on forums, put up a blog post, posted a comment, talked to a friend or made a YouTube video about a *Zelda* theory, *we need you*!
